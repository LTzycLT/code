On balance, we recommend ran1 for general use. It is portable, based on
Park and Miller’s Minimal Standard generator with an additional shuffle, and has no known (to us) flaws other than period exhaustion.

If you are generating more than 100,000,000 random numbers in a single calculation (that is, more than about 5% of ran1’s period), we recommend the use of ran2, with its much longer period.
