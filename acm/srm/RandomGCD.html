PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consider the integers between low and high, inclusive.
We are going to select a sequence of N integers from this range.
The sequence is allowed to contain repeated elements, hence there are (high-low+1)^N possible sequences (where '^' denotes exponentiation).

Out of those sequences, we are only interested in the ones that have one additional property:
the greatest common divisor (GCD) of their elements must be exactly K.

You are given the ints N, K, low, and high.
Let X be the number of N-tuples described above.
Because X can be very large, compute and return the value (X modulo 1,000,000,007).

DEFINITION
Class:RandomGCD
Method:countTuples
Parameters:int, int, int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int countTuples(int N, int K, int low, int high)


NOTES
-The greatest common divisor of a sequence is the largest positive integer that divides each element of the sequence.


CONSTRAINTS
-N, K and low will each be between 1 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive.
-high will be between low and 1,000,000,000, inclusive.
-The difference high - low will be less than or equal to 100,000.


EXAMPLES

4

Returns: 3

There are 9 possible sequences: {(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}.
Out of these, 3 of them have the requested gcd of 2: {(2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)}.
Hence, the answer is 3.
