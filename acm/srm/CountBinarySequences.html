PROBLEM STATEMENT

Anu loves binary sequences of length n.
A binary sequence of length n has n elements (indexed from 1 to n) and each of those elements is either a zero (0) or a one (1).



You are given the int n.
You are also given an int k and two equally long vector <int>s L and R.
For each valid i, the values L[i] and R[i] are the left and right endpoints of a range of indices.
Both endpoints are included in the range.
For example, L[0]=3 and R[0]=7 represents the indices from 3 to 7, inclusive.
We will denote this range [3,7].



The ranges defined by L and R satisfy one additional restriction:
Given any two ranges, either one is contained in the other, or they are disjoint.
For example, it cannot be the case that L = {1, 4, 10} and R = {5, 7, 20} because none of the ranges [1,5] and [4,7] contains the other, and they are also not disjoint.



Anu wants to count the number of binary sequences of length n that satisfy the following properties:

There are never more than k consecutive ones in the sequence.
Each of the ranges defined by L and R has an even sum.

Return the number of such sequences, modulo 10^9 + 7.


DEFINITION
Class:CountBinarySequences
Method:countSequences
Parameters:int, int, vector <int>, vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int countSequences(int n, int k, vector <int> L, vector <int> R)


CONSTRAINTS
-n will be between 1 and 1,000,000,000 (10^9), inclusive.
-k will be between 1 and 5, inclusive.
-L will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-R will contain the same number of elements as L.
-For each valid i, L[i] will be less than or equal to R[i].
-All elements of L and R will be between 1 and n, inclusive.
-All ranges defined by L and R will be distinct.
-For any two ranges defined by L and R, either one will be contained in the other, or they will be disjoint.

The five valid sequences are 0000, 0001, 0110, 1000, and 1001.

{2}

Returns: 6

We cannot have two consecutive ones.
The range [2,2] contains only the index 2.
As the sum of this range must be even, the element at index 2 must be a zero.
Hence, the six valid sequences are 0000, 0001, 0010, 1000, 1001, and 1010.
