PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this problem we consider undirected graphs on n vertices.
The vertices are numbered 0 through n-1.
The graphs are simple: they do not contain self-loops, and each pair of vertices is directly connected using at most one edge.

An undirected connected graph is called Eulerian if there is a closed walk that contains each edge of the graph exactly once.
(A closed walk is a sequence of consecutive edges that starts and ends in the same vertex.)

Bomboslav invented his own kind of graphs that he calls almost-Eulerian.
All Eulerian graphs are also almost-Eulerian.
Additionally, a graph is also almost-Eulerian if there exists a way to add or remove exactly one edge to/from it in such a way that the resulting graph becomes Eulerian.
(Note that if you are adding an edge, you are not allowed to create a self-loop and you are not allowed to connect vertices that are already connected by another edge.)

An example of an almost-Eulerian graph.After removing the selected edge, it becomes Eulerian..

Bomboslav is now interested in calculating the number X of different almost-Eulerian graphs on n vertices.
Two graphs are considered different if there exists a pair of indices 0 <= i < j <= n-1 such that the edge (i, j) is present in exactly one of those two graphs.
Compute and return the value (X modulo 1,000,000,007).
